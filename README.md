# Pixel Art Maker

This is a lab project previous to the second project of FEND program. The goal is to create a one-page web application that lets users draw a pixel image on a customizable panel.We'll be given starter code (including HTML and CSS) to build the application. We'll write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece! :).
